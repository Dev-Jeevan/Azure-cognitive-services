Used Azure custom vision to classify a set of images based on its brand.


(1) Identified a few featured shoe's brands and collected a set of images of each brands.

(2) Train the custom vision model with the image collection.

(3) Tested the trained model with similar and non-similar images to check the accuracy.

To conclude this work, shoe brands with similar-identifiable logo have been recognized with above 90% accuracy. However i tested few other objects to see if the model identifies and apportion it to a specific brand, and it has come out positive as few unrealted objects has been classfied to the shoe brands based on its color, shape and other factors. The accuracy of the model can be improved drastically by training the model with a large number of images.
